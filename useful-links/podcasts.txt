From the "About": 
Each week we break down real business wins using n8n and AI automation. You’ll learn what worked, why it worked, 
and what broke along the way. Founders, automation experts, and AI agencies share how they use n8n to simplify operations, 
scale delivery, and move faster without adding more people.
The n8n Masterclass is not about tutorials or tech jargon. It focuses on the real business side of automation, the frameworks, 
decision patterns, and creative problem solving that turn workflows into results.
